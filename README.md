# map-your-google-locations
[MaptimeBUF](http://maptime.io/buffalo/) Meetup on March 28 2017

Presented by: Rick Ciesla ([@rtbigdata](https://github.com/rtbigdata))

The GPS data from your Android phone can be downloaded from your Google account and displayed on OpenStreetMap!  This presentation highlighted techniques to process the raw location data using Python into a web-friendly GeoJSON format.  Once coverted, the data is loaded into MongoDB and served up using Node.js, Express, and Leaflet.
